# React Portfolio

## Description

This is my developer portfolio, which has been overhauled in React as a Single Page Application (SPA). Users can visit the site and click on any of the section headers in the navigation bar — About, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume — and load the content of those sections without ever reloading the page. It's mobile responsive and has links to a bunch of my deployed GitHub stuff, so come check it out sometime!
